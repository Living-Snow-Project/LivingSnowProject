Living Snow Project is a Citizen\Community Scientist project that studies snow algae. That's right, algae grows on snow (and ice) too! The purpose of this app is to assist the research team with data collection. More info [here](https://wp.wwu.edu/livingsnowproject/).

The app is written in React Native and Expo using their 'managed' workflow.
