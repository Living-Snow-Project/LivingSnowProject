The app is written in React-Native then built and tested through Expo using its 'managed workflow'.

Getting started:

1. Follow the Requirements and Recommended instructions here: https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/
2. Don't install Expo CLI with npm - use yarn (yarn global add expo-cli)
3. Create a project folder and clone the repo to it
4. run 'yarn start' and make sure the Expo Client app is on your mobile device
